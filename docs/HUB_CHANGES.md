# Hub changes needed by the payslip app

A to-do list for the `payroll-hub` repo, written from the payslip repo on 6 October 2026 and updated on 7 October 2026 to say what was built. Every SQL file is run by hand by the owner in the Supabase SQL editor. `bridge.js` is not changed by any item.

Status: items 1 and 2 are done and merged (Stage A). Items 3 to 7, 9 and 10 are built on the branch `feature/payslip-bridge-b` (Stage B), not merged; migrations 0008 to 0010 are written and still to be run. Item 8 is not started.

The contract the payslip app codes against is `docs/INTEGRATION.md`, payslip section. Where this file and that one differ, that one is right.

## Before the payroll app sends the new columns

1. **Store and return "Employee CSG" and "Employee NSF".** DONE.
   - Both are in `PAYROLL_FIELDS` (`src/config/payrollFields.ts`) as numbers, sensitive, not required. They are stored in `payroll_entries.extra` as `employee_csg` and `employee_nsf` and returned by `toExportRow` as `"Employee CSG"` and `"Employee NSF"`.
   - A value that is absent stays absent: never 0 or "", so the payslip app can report the missing figure. Text in either field is refused at import, like the other money fields.
   - No migration: `extra` is already `jsonb` and `import_payroll_run` (migration 0002) already saves it.

## Payslip Phase 2 (bridge)

2. **Registry entry.** DONE. `payslip` is active at `${HOSTING.apps}/payslip/` (trailing slash kept).

## Payslip Phase 3 (templates, rates, date of employment)

3. **Date of employment.** BUILT.
   - Migration `0008_employee_date_of_employment.sql` adds `employees.date_of_employment date`, optional.
   - An admin types it in the Data explorer (a column with an edit dialog per employee), behind the password gate.
   - Rows of a saved run carry `"Date of Employment"` (text, `YYYY-MM-DD`) when it is set; the key is left out when it is not.
   - An import never sets or overwrites it. When a file has a "Date of Employment" key, the import report says in one line that it is ignored and that the date is set in the Data explorer.

4. **Protocol additions (still version 1, additive only).** BUILT, in `src/lib/bridge/protocol.ts`.
   - `request-data` payload: an optional `params` object (at most 2 KB), checked per data type by its handler.
   - `response-data` ok payload: `rows` may be empty for the new data types. `payroll-result` keeps its minimum of one row. `meta` may carry `brn`.
   - `received` ok payload (the hub's reply to an app's `send-data`): an optional `result` object. A refusal may carry a `code`.
   - Refusal codes added: `stale`, `no-change`, `forbidden`, `wrong-company`, `invalid`, `not-found`, `too-large` (`unavailable` existed).
   - Limits per data type (`DATA_RULES`): one row per save for rates and templates; 4 KB for a rates row; 160 KB for a template message, of which the body may be 150 KB.
   - Added beyond the original list: a save may take time. The hub sends exactly one answer, the outcome or its own `unavailable` after 8 seconds (`bridge.js` waits 10). After `unavailable` or no answer, the app must reload and compare the revision before saving again.

5. **Registry data types.** BUILT for two of the three. `payslip` accepts `payroll-result`, `statutory-rates`, `payslip-template` and produces `statutory-rates`, `payslip-template`. `payslip-issue` is added with item 8; until then it is answered with "not registered". Later, `payroll` accepts `statutory-rates`.

6. **`statutory-rates` (a SHARED table, not payslip-only).** BUILT. Migration `0009_statutory_rates.sql`.
   - `statutory_rates`: per company, `effective_from` (first of a month), `revision`, `nsf_employee_rate`, `nsf_ceiling`, `nsf_exempt_at_60`, `csg_employee_rate_low`, `csg_employee_rate_high`, `csg_threshold`, `source_note`, `created_by`, `created_at`.
   - Insert-only, and only through the function `save_statutory_rates`: members read, admins add a revision, no insert, update or delete policy or grant. The rows are the change log. A correction is a new row with the same `effective_from` and the next `revision`.
   - Changed from the outline: the caller sends `expected_revision` (the latest revision it has seen for that month, 0 for none). A save that is behind is refused as `stale`, an identical one as `no-change`. At most 1,000 rows per company.
   - Names are generic so the payroll app can read the same rows later. Employer-side rates, when the payroll app needs them, are added by a later migration as new columns.
   - Not in this table: which payroll column is the base of the calculation. That is a mapping, kept in the payslip template.
   - The higher CSG rate applies strictly ABOVE the threshold; no flag is needed.
   - Handlers: a request returns every version for the selected company; a save adds one revision, with the values exactly as sent. No prompt and no password gate.

7. **`payslip-template`.** BUILT. Migration `0010_payslip_templates.sql`.
   - `payslip_templates` (name, draft body, draft revision) and `payslip_template_versions` (immutable published versions, who and when).
   - Two functions: `save_payslip_template_draft` (creates a template, or saves over its draft only if the caller's revision is still the current one) and `publish_payslip_template`. No direct writes.
   - Handlers: `list` (no bodies), `load` (the draft, or a published version), `save-draft`, `publish`. A stale save or publish is refused as `stale`; publishing an unchanged draft as `no-change`.
   - Limits: a body of at most 150 KB at the hub (256 KB in the database), 50 templates per company, names unique whatever the capitals, no images in a body. Viewers may read drafts.
   - Left out on purpose: deleting or archiving a template (docs/FUTURE_WORK.md, section 9c).
   - No prompt and no password gate, as for rates.

## Payslip Phase 4 (issued payslips)

8. **`payslip-issue`.** NOT STARTED. Migration `0011_issued_payslips.sql`: `issued_payslips` (company, employee, period, revision, template version, rates snapshot, the exact lines shown, accepted differences, who, when). Insert-only through one atomic function; admin-only read.
   - The save carries the BRN and the period. The hub refuses it if the BRN is not the selected company's.
   - Reads and saves sit behind the password gate; add the query key to `GATED_QUERY_KEYS` (`src/lib/queryClient.ts`).
   - A request with a period returns that month's issued payslips (used for the month comparison).
   - It follows the same wire contract as items 6 and 7 (an action per row, `brn`, refusal codes), with the prompt-free rule NOT applying: this is per-employee data.

## For every migration above that adds a table

9. **`delete_company`.** BUILT for 0009 and 0010: each replaces the function with its tables added, deleted by name and counted (`rates`, `templates`, `template_versions`). The newest definition is in 0010. The dashboard's preview before a delete counts the three tables too. Migration 0011 will do the same.

10. **Transfer log and tests.** BUILT. Requests and saves go through `answerRequest()` and `recordSave()` in `src/features/workspace/deliver.ts`: one Transfer log row each, with no values. "Get from dashboard" for `payroll-result` is logged the same way. Protocol, handler and PGlite migration tests are in place, and `npm run test:prove` covers the Stage B rules. The test that keeps `HUB_ORIGIN` equal to the dashboard origin is unchanged.

## For the owner to do by hand

11. Run migrations 0008, 0009 and 0010 in the Supabase SQL editor, in that order, before the Stage B code is deployed (0007 first if it has not been run yet). Each file ends with one verification row in which every column should be true. Migration 0011 comes with item 8.

## Payslip Phase 5 (month review), written 8 October 2026

The month review needs nothing new from the hub. It uses two requests the hub already answers: `payslip-issue` `{ action: "load", brn, period }` for last month's issued payslips, and `request-data { dataType: "payroll-result", period }` for last month's payroll run when no payslip was issued. The two items below would make it sturdier; neither is started, and the app works without them.

12. **A code for "no payroll for that month".** NOT STARTED, small. Today a request for a month with no saved run is refused with a sentence and no code ("There is no saved run for 2026-08.", "That run has no employees."), like a request the bridge gave up on. The payslip app has to recognise the sentence to tell "nothing to compare with" from a failure. Wanted: `code: "not-found"` on those two refusals (the app already accepts it), the sentences kept as they are. Also useful: `meta.brn` on a `payroll-result` answer, as on the other answers, so the app can check the company before it reads a row.

13. **A record of the month review (later).** NOT STARTED, to design. The app keeps "reviewed", "approved" and "acknowledged" marks in memory only, because an issued payslip accepts no other key. If an audit trail is wanted (who reviewed which employee against which revision of last month, and when), the hub needs a place for it: for example an optional, strictly checked key on each payslip of an issue, or one row per issue. Nothing in it would be a payroll figure. Until then the review leaves no trace once the tab is closed.
